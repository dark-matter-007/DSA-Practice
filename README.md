# DSA-Practice

> Q1. Given an array arr, write a program segregating even and odd numbers. The program should put all even numbers first in sorted order, and then odd numbers in sorted order.
> <br><br> Note:- You don't have to return the array, you have to modify it in-place.
>> Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3]
>> <br> Output: [8, 12, 34, 90, 3, 9, 45]
>> <br> Explanation: Even numbers are 12, 34, 8 and 90. Rest are odd numbers.
>
>> Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>> <br> Output: [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]
>> <br> Explanation: 0 2 4 are even and 1 3 are odd numbers.
> 
>> Input: arr[] = [10, 22, 4, 6]
>> <br> Output: [10, 22, 4, 6]
>> <br> Explanation: Here all elements are even, so no need of segregataion
